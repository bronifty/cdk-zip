# CDK Zip Fastify

- got fastify-aws-lambda working in cdk by bundling each server file (app and lambda handler which imports app) and dropping them in a zip with a generic function

- now want to get to know fastify and convert remix-run-react-router app server file to use fastify then deploy it (ssr-data-router)
